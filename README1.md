I'm vibe coding a Govcon AI RAG using Langchain. Everything will be public. 
The knowledge base will a uniqely curated set of books, trainings and documents.
Maybe I'll learn a thing or two in the process.
i'll try to make note which AI model assisted me with each commit. I'll also note when I did it on my own.
Let's go!
